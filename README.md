# Technical Information 
 
you must create a Makefile, and the ouput is the command itself It will contain rule all/clean/fclean (re => fclean + all) 
 
You can use: 
 
printf(3) 
write(2) 
read(2) 
rand() (/ srand()) 
time() 
atoi() 
strcmp() 
You can NOT use: 
Any functions/syscalls which does not appear in the previous list 
Yes, it includes exit 
Consider writing a README.md to describe your project and how it works. 
 
Your mastermind needs to handle the sequence Ctrl + d. It's End Of File. It's consider as a normal execution. 
 
read() is a syscall difficult to apprehend, you will have time to deal more with it in a later project. In this project, you should read 1 character by 1 (use read(0, &c, 1)) and add them one by one to a buffer until you encounter a newline. 
 
# Descriprion Task 
 
Mastermind is a game composed of 9 pieces of different colors. A secret code is then composed of 4 distinct pieces. 
 
The player has 10 attempts to find the secret code. After each input, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces. 
 
Pieces will be '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8'. 
 
If the player finds the code, he wins, and the game stops. A misplaced piece is a piece that is present in the secret code butthat is not in a good position. 
 
You must read the player's input from the standard input. 
 
Your program will also receive the following parameters: -c [CODE]: specifies the secret code. If no code is specified, a random code will be generated. -t [ATTEMPTS]: specifies the number of attempts; by default, the playerhas 10 attempts. 
 
# Mastermind Game 
 
but it wasn’t easy, but somehow I was able to do it thanks to my teacher, without him I couldn’t have done it I mainly settled on misplace Wellplace was easy to solve, but the most important thing was that I was able to do it 
 
Mastermind this is a simple implementation of the Mastermind game in C. The Mastermind game is a code-breaking game where the player tries to guess the secret code generated by the computer. 
 
## Features 
 
- Generates a random 4-digit secret code.- Allows the player to guess the code within a limited number of attempts. 
- Provides feedback on the correctness of the guessed code. 
 
## How to Play 
 
1. Run the program.2. Enter your guesses when prompted, following the format of a 4-digit number. 
2. Receive feedback on the correctness of your guesses.4. Keep guessing until you crack the code or run out of attempts.
