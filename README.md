  # Welcome to arc-01-my_mastermind
    
 ## Installation
Compiling the program: Use the provided Makefile to compile the program. Simply run the "make" command in the terminal. The Makefile should handle the compilation process and create an executable for "my_mastermind".

   To compile the program, use the provided Makefile and ensure the code is compiled with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror

 ## Task
  Implement the "mastermind.c" file that contains the game logic. This includes functions such as generating a secret code, counting well-placed and misplaced parts, and other auxiliary functions that you will need.
 You will need to create a folder and in this folder will be additional files containing your work.
 Folder names must start with special file names and also contain ( Makefile - _.c - _.h).
 ## Usage
 
  Continue entering guesses until you either guess the secret code correctly or exhaust the specified number of attempts.

  Execute the program my_mastermind with the appropriate parameters and follow the prompts to input guesses for the secret code.

 ## Description

  There are two players in the game: the code maker and the code breaker. The code generator generates a secret code consisting of colored blocks or a sequence of numbers. The goal of a code cracker is to guess the secret code within a limited number of attempts.

  These functions implement the main functions of the My Mastermind game. The rest of the program controls the flow of the game using these functions.
