## Description
This project is a number guessing game implemented in C. The game generates a secret code consisting of four unique digits, and the player needs to guess the code within a specified number of turns. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the correctness of the guess. The player wins if they guess the code correctly within the given number of turns.

## Task
The task of this project is to implement a number guessing game using C language. The game should generate a random secret code and allow the player to input their guesses. The game should provide feedback on the correctness of each guess and keep track of the number of turns taken by the player. The game should also have a maximum number of turns allowed, and if the player fails to guess the code within the specified turns, the game should end and display a "Game Over" message.

## Usage
To play the game, follow these steps:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The game will provide feedback on the correctness of your guess.
4. Keep guessing until you either guess the code correctly or reach the maximum number of turns.
5. If you guess the code correctly, you win the game. If you exceed the maximum number of turns, you lose the game.

## Installation
To install and run the game, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the code using the appropriate compiler command.
4. Run the compiled executable.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
