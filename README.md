## Task

For each exercise you will need to create a folder, and in this folder will be additional files containing your work.
The folder names are listed at the beginning of each exercise under the shipping directory, and the file names specific to each exercise are listed under the file(s) provided at the beginning of each exercise.

Submit files:

      Makefile - *.c - *.h

```

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

For Windows users, you can install **MinGW**, which includes the **gcc** compiler.

## Usage
