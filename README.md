## Welcome to my_mastermind

Mastermind is a classic board game that involves logic and deduction. The goal of the game is for one player, called the "codebreaker," to guess the secret code created by another player, known as the "codemaker." The secret code is a sequence of colored pegs, and the codebreaker must try to determine the exact sequence within a limited number of guesses.

## Task

In this game you will have to find the secret code that is included.
The secret code consists of four digits. These numbers are not duplicated.

## Description

The program provides a code address consisting of four error digits (between 0-8) and the user to calculate the code. After each guess, the program evaluates the user's software and calculates the number of correct pointers in the calculation (a good result) and the output that is present in the code but directly tells the user the number of numbers (false result).

## Usage
Follow these steps to play the game:

The program asks you to enter a correct guess.
Enter 4 codes consisting of numbers from 0 to 8.
Keep guessing until you find the correct code or run out of tries.
Start the game:
1) You enter the secret code using '-c'.
2) You enter the number of attempts using '-t'
