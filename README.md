# Description

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where the player attempts to guess a secret code consisting of four distinct pieces out of nine possible colors. The player has a limited number of attempts to decipher the code. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating the number of correctly placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.

# Task

I wrote Mastermind game in C programming language. The program allows the player to enter their guesses, provide feedback on each guess, and end the game when the code is guessed correctly or the maximum number of attempts is reached.

# Usage

./my_mastermind or ./my_mastermind -c "0123" -t 10

# Installation

Just download the code and type mingw32-make or make in the terminal
