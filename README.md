## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

Since I haven't worked in C for a long time, I had to remember some functions and I had a hard time compiling some functions.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?

My friends helped me to solve this problem. For example I had to accept "string" from the user every time. But I didn't know to accept "String". A boy named Ulugbek helped me make it

## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?

I #include <stdio.h> in my program #include <string.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <time.h> #include <stdbool.h> I used the #include <unistd.h> libraries

## Usage
How does it work?

This program accepts secret codes and rounds entered from the terminal after -c and -t symbols, and my scode and cysle functions! 
If no information is entered, my cysle function will return 10 and my scode function will return a random 4-character string from 0 to -> 8! cycle 
by the number of rounds received. Inside the loop, the input function takes 4 non-identical characters from the user, 0 to -> 8, consisting of 4 
characters. If the information is not entered correctly, it will ask to enter information again and "wrong input!" consil the record! secret 
code and the numbers entered by the user, the welp function counts equal signs and returns! if the value returned by the wellp function is equal to 4, 
the message "Congratz! You did it!" will be output to the console!

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
