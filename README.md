## Mastermind Game

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player creates a secret code and the other player tries to guess the code within a limited number of attempts. The code consists of a sequence of colored pegs, and the guessing player must make educated guesses based on feedback provided for each guess.

## Description

This program implements the Mastermind game in C. It provides a command-line interface for players to interact with the game. The game generates a random secret code or accepts a user-provided code, and the player attempts to guess the code within a specified number of attempts. Feedback is provided after each guess to help the player refine their guesses.
