Certainly! Writing a README file is a good practice to provide guidance on how to use your program. Below is an example README file for your Mastermind game:

# Mastermind Game

**Introduction:**

This is a simple implementation of the Mastermind game in C. The program generates a secret code, and the user's goal is to guess the code based on feedback provided by the program.

**How to Play:**

1. **Compile the Program:**
   - Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
   - Compile the program using the following command:
     ```
     gcc mastermind.c -o mastermind
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```
     ./mastermind
     ```

3. **Gameplay:**
   - The program will generate a secret code, and you will be prompted to guess the code.
   - Enter your guess following the on-screen instructions.
   - The program will provide feedback on your guess, indicating the number of well-placed and misplaced pieces.
   - Continue guessing until you find the correct code.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - If you correctly guess the entire code, the program will congratulate you, and the game will end.

**Code Structure:**

- `mastermind.c`: The main C source code file containing the implementation of the Mastermind game.

**Dependencies:**

- This program relies on the standard C libraries and should work on most systems with a C compiler.

**Note:**

- The program uses a simple algorithm to generate a random secret code and provides feedback on the correctness of the user's guesses.

Feel free to modify the code or adapt it according to your preferences. Happy playing!
