Welcome to `my_mastermind`, a simple command-line implementation of the Mastermind game.

## Task

Your task is to guess the secret code generated by the program within a certain number of rounds.

## Description

In the Mastermind game, the computer generates a secret code consisting of four digits from 0 to 9. The digits can be repeated, and the code is hidden from the player. The player's goal is to guess the secret code within a limited number of attempts.

After each guess, the program provides feedback to the player. The feedback includes the number of digits that are correctly placed (well-placed pieces) and the number of digits that are in the code but not in the correct position (misplaced pieces).

The game continues until the player guesses the code correctly or exhausts the allowed number of attempts.
