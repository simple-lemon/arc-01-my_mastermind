## Task

This program simulates the classic Mastermind game, where the player tries to guess a secret code within a limited number of rounds.

## Description

The program generates a secret code consisting of four digits. The player has multiple rounds to guess the code. After each guess, the program provides feedback on how many digits are correctly placed (well-placed pieces) and how many digits are correct but not in the correct position (misplaced pieces). The player wins if they guess the code within the specified rounds.

## Installation

This program does not require any additional installation steps.

## Usage

To use this program, compile it and run the executable from the command line. Optionally, you can specify the number of rounds using the '-t' flag followed by the desired number of rounds.
