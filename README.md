## Introduction

This program is a simple implementation of a guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret code generated by the computer. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating how many digits are correctly placed and how many are misplaced.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the program, simply use any C compiler, for example:

```
gcc -o guessing_game guessing_game.c
```

To run the program, execute the compiled binary:

```
./guessing_game
```

## Usage

The program can be executed with various command-line arguments to customize the game's behavior. The available options are:

- `-c secret_code` : Allows you to provide the secret code directly as a command-line argument. The secret code must be a 4-digit number with unique digits.
- `-t attempts` : Specifies the number of attempts the player has to guess the code. If not specified, the default is 10 attempts.

You can combine these options to set both the secret code and the number of attempts. Here are some examples:

```
./guessing_game -c 1234
./guessing_game -t 5
./guessing_game -c 5678 -t 12
```

## Gameplay

Once the game starts, you'll be prompted to enter your guess. Enter a 4-digit number with unique digits. The game will then provide feedback on your guess, indicating how many digits are correctly placed (black) and how many are misplaced but exist in the secret code (white).

Keep guessing within the specified number of attempts. If you guess the correct code within the given attempts, you win! Otherwise, the game will reveal the secret code at the end.
