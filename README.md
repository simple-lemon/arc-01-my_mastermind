<h3>Description</h3>
<h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
<p>Write a program called mastermind; it will be an implementation of the famous game.</p>
<h3>NAME</h3>
<p>my_mastermind</p>
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>my_mastermind [-ct]</p>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>Mastermind is a game composed of 9 pieces of different colors.
A secret code is then composed of 4 distinct pieces.</p>
<p>The player has 10 attempts to find the secret code.
After each input, the game indicates to the player the number of well placed pieces and the number of misplaced pieces.</p>
<p>Pieces will be '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8'.</p>
<p>If the player finds the code, he wins, and the game stops.
A misplaced piece is a piece that is present in the secret code butthat is not in a good position.</p>
<p>You must read the player's input from the standard input.</p>
<p>Your program will also receive the following parameters:
-c [CODE]: specifies the secret code. If no code is specified, a random code will be generated.
-t [ATTEMPTS]: specifies the number of attempts; by default, the playerhas 10 attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Example 00</strong></p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">PROMPT&gt;./my_mastermind -c "0123"
Will you find the secret code?
Please enter a valid guess

Round 0

Well placed pieces: 0
Misplaced pieces: 1

Round 1

Wrong input!
&gt;4132
Well placed pieces: 1
Misplaced pieces: 2

Round 2

Congratz! You did it!
</code></pre>
<h3>Technical information</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>you must create a Makefile, and the ouput is the command itself
It will contain rule all/clean/fclean (re =&gt; fclean + all)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>printf(3)</li>
<li>write(2)</li>
<li>read(2)</li>
<li>rand() (/ srand())</li>
<li>time()</li>
<li>atoi()</li>
<li>strcmp()</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>You can NOT use:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Any functions/syscalls which does not appear in the previous list</li>
<li>Yes, it includes <strong>exit</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Consider writing a README.md to describe your project and how it works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your mastermind needs to handle the sequence <code>Ctrl + d</code>. It's End Of File.
It's consider as a normal execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>read() is a syscall difficult to apprehend, you will have time to deal more with it in a later project. In this project, you should read 1 character by 1 (use read(0, &amp;c, 1)) and add them one by one to a buffer until you encounter a newline.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">[/tmp/]bash
bash-3.2$ exit
[/tmp/]
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, bash exited successfully and also printed "exit".</p>
<h3>Output formats</h3>
<ol>
<li>When your program starts, you must display:</li>
</ol>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">Will you find the secret code?
Please enter a valid guess
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>When the user wins, you must display:</li>
</ol>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">Congratz! You did it!
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>When the user enters an invalid code, you must respect the following format:</li>
</ol>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">Well placed pieces: X
Misplaced pieces: Y
</code></pre>
<p>X and Y are two digits with the correct values.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your code must be compiled with the flags <strong>-Wall -Wextra -Werror</strong>.</li>
<li>Multiline macros are forbidden</li>
<li>You should have multiple file .c but it's forbidden to include them (#include another_file.c) use your Makefile to compile them together.</li>
<li>Macros with logic (while/if/variables/...) are forbidden</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advanced Testing</h3>
<p>Gandalf tests using a synthax similar to this one:</p>
<pre class=" language-plain"><code class=" language-plain">echo "1234
2345
3456" | ./my_mastermind -c 3456
</code></pre>
<p>It will hightlight that you are not using read() well.</p>
<h3>Hint(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li>man 2 read</li>
<li>man rand</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>M</strong>akefile, case sensitivity is important.</p>

### Welcome to My Mastermind â€“ a classic code-breaking game implemented in C. This project is a modern adaptation of the famous Mastermind game where players attempt to guess a secret code within a limited number of tries.

## Description
In this version of Mastermind, the game is composed of a secret code made of 4 distinct numeric characters ranging from 0 to 8. The player has a certain number of attempts to guess this code. After each guess, the game provides feedback by indicating the number of correctly placed digits and the number of correct digits that are misplaced.

## Installation
To install and run My Mastermind, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Navigate to the source code directory.
Compile the game using the provided Makefile:
bash
Copy code
make
Run the game:
bash
Copy code
./my_mastermind
Optional Command Line Arguments
-c [CODE]: Set a custom secret code for the game. If not set, a random code will be generated.
-t [ATTEMPTS]: Specify the number of attempts. Default is 10.
Example of starting a game with a custom code and attempt limit:

bash
Copy code
./my_mastermind -c "0123" -t 15

### Usage
Once the game starts, you will be prompted to enter your guess for the secret code. Enter a guess composed of 4 distinct digits and press Enter. The game will then provide feedback about your guess:

Well placed pieces: Number of digits that are correct and in the right position.
Misplaced pieces: Number of correct digits but in the wrong position.
Continue guessing until you either crack the code or run out of attempts.

### Ending Notes

Enjoy cracking the code in My Mastermind! This game is a great exercise in logic and deduction. Feel free to explore the source code and contribute to its development.
