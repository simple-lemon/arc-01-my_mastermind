## Task

- [x] You will need to create a folder and in this folder will be additional files containing your work.
- [x] Folder names must start with special file names and also contain ( Makefile - _.c - _.h).
- [x] The player must follow the Mastermind game rules.

- [x] Guesses entered by the player are checked and feedback is given whether they are correct or incorrect.

## Description

The player has several attempts to find the secret code. If the player finds the code, he wins and the game stops. A misplaced part is a part that is present in the secret code but not in good condition.

## Installation

1. Install a C compiler such as GCC.
2. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/darmanovjakhongir/arc-01-my_mastermind.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory using `cd arc-01-my_mastermind`.
4. Build the project using `make`.
5. Run the following command to compile the program `gcc mastermind.c -o mastermind`.
6. Now you can run the program using the following command `./mastermind`.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the compiled program. The game will prompt you to enter your guess. After each guess, the game will provide you with a hint about the correctness of your guess. You can continue guessing until you guess the correct code.
If you want to play again, simply run the program again, and a new game will start.

Remember to have fun playing this game, and feel free to modify the source code and try your own ideas to enhance the game.
