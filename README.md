  ## Task
  Implement the "mastermind.c" file that contains the game logic. This includes functions such as generating a secret code, counting well-placed and misplaced parts, and other auxiliary functions that you will need.

  ## Description

There are two players in the game: the code maker and the code breaker. The code generator generates a secret code consisting of colored blocks or a sequence of numbers. The goal of a code cracker is to guess the secret code within a limited number of attempts.

These functions implement the main functions of the My Mastermind game. The rest of the program controls the flow of the game using these functions.
