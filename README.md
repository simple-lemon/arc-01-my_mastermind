Sure, I can help you draft a README for your `my_mastermind` program. Below is a basic outline you can use as a starting point:

---

# my_mastermind

## Task

The task of `my_mastermind` is to guess a secret code within a limited number of attempts. The code is a sequence of four unique digits, and the player needs to guess the correct combination through a series of guesses. After each guess, the player receives feedback on how many digits are correctly placed and how many are misplaced.

## Description

`my_mastermind` is a command-line game implemented in C. It generates a secret code randomly or accepts a user-defined code as input. The player then attempts to guess the code within a specified number of rounds. After each guess, feedback is provided to the player to assist in refining subsequent guesses. The game ends either when the player correctly guesses the code or exhausts all rounds without success.

## Installation

To compile `my_mastermind`, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. You can compile the program using the following command:

```bash
gcc -o my_mastermind my_mastermind.c
```

This will generate an executable file named `my_mastermind`.

## Usage

To play `my_mastermind`, run the compiled executable from the command line. You can specify the number of rounds and/or provide a custom secret code using command-line arguments. Below are examples of usage:

```bash
./my_mastermind           
./my_mastermind -t 15     
./my_mastermind -c 1234   
./my_mastermind -t 10 -c 5678
```

Follow the prompts on the screen to input your guesses and interact with the game.
